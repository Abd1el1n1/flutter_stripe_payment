# flutter_stripe_payment

Add Stripe to your Flutter Application to Accept Card Payments using Payment Intents and the Latest SCA Compliance 3DS Requirements

The Payment Intents API is a new way to build dynamic payment flows. It tracks the lifecycle of a customer checkout flow and triggers additional authentication steps when required by regulatory mandates, custom Radar fraud rules, or redirect-based payment methods.
